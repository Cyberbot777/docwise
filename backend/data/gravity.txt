Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts all objects with mass or energy towards each other. It's the force that keeps us on the ground, causes objects to fall, and governs the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies. Essentially, anything with mass has gravity, and the more massive an object, the stronger its gravitational pull
