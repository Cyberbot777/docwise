Goal: Open your .bashrc file in Git Bash

This file is in your home directory, and it holds custom settings — like the aliases we’re adding.
Step-by-Step Instructions

    Make sure you are in your Git Bash terminal.

    You should see something like:

    cyber@Cyber MINGW64 ~

    That ~ means you are in your home folder, which is perfect.

    Type this command to open .bashrc:

    nano .bashrc

        nano is a built-in terminal text editor.

        .bashrc is the name of the file we want to edit.

    If it works, you’ll see a text editor open up in the terminal window.

    If that worked, you’re now in the editor.

    Use your arrow keys to go down to the bottom of the file, and then add this line:

    alias codefolder='cd /c/Users/cyber/OneDrive/Desktop/code'

    Now save the file:

        Press Ctrl + X (this starts the exit).

        Press Y (this means “yes, save changes”).

        Press Enter (to confirm the filename and save).

    Apply the change by running:

    source .bashrc

    This reloads the file so your alias works right away.

    Now test your new alias:

codefolder

That should instantly take you into your code folder!
